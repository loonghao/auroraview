//! Pluggable render-backend contract.
//!
//! A *render backend* owns the actual web surface. Two families must be
//! reachable through the same contract:
//!
//! * [`BackendFamily::Native`] -- the platform webview (WebView2 on Windows,
//!   WKWebView on macOS, WebKitGTK on Linux). Small, no bundled runtime.
//! * [`BackendFamily::Chromium`] -- a bundled Chromium-class engine. Heavy, but
//!   the only path that gives a real CDP endpoint, DevTools protocol parity and
//!   identical rendering across platforms.
//!
//! # Relationship to the existing `auroraview-core::backend`
//!
//! `auroraview-core::backend` already defines `WebViewBackend`, but its
//! `BackendFactory` is a closed `match` over a `BackendType` enum: adding a
//! backend means editing core, and `BackendType::WebView2` on Windows silently
//! returns the same `WryBackend` as `BackendType::Wry`. This module keeps the
//! trait design and replaces the closed factory with a registry, so a backend
//! becomes a registration instead of a core edit.
//!
//! # Probing never fails
//!
//! [`RenderBackend::probe`] returns [`CapabilitySupport`] -- see
//! [`crate::capability`]. A backend that is not linked into the build reports
//! `Unsupported` with a build flag to flip, rather than panicking or returning
//! an opaque internal error.
