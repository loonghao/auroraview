// Module-level close channel.
//
// `AuroraView` is `#[pyclass(unsendable)]`, so PyO3 aborts any `#[pymethods]`
// body that runs on a thread other than the one that created the object, and
// `wry`/`tao` windows must be destroyed on their creator thread as well
// (violating that is a hard main-thread crash on macOS).
//
// Closing is the one operation that has to stay reachable from anywhere - a
// DCC host closes a window from its main thread while the WebView lives on a
// background thread - so the request is never executed inline. It is always
// handed back to the owner thread through this module-level channel, which is
// built from state that is already shared cross-thread: the
// `Arc<MessageQueue>` drained by the owner thread's event loop, plus the
// `EventLoopProxy` that wakes that loop up.
//
// Both halves are `Send`, so no part of this module ever needs to borrow the
// `unsendable` object to ask for a close.

/// window stayed alive until the process exited - which is exactly the
/// "unit tests never close the window" symptom. Dropping now asks the event
/// loop to exit and then releases the inner WebView, whose own `Drop` destroys
/// the window.

/// `#[pyclass(unsendable)]`, so PyO3 gates deallocation on its thread checker:
/// when the object is released on a thread other than the creating one, PyO3
/// writes an unraisable `RuntimeError`, skips the value destructor entirely and
/// leaks the object - `AuroraView::drop` is never entered. That is PyO3's
/// unsendable contract, not something this `Drop` impl can route around, so
