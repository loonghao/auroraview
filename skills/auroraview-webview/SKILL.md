# AuroraView WebView

Control a running AuroraView instance from the DCC-MCP control plane.

AuroraView is a lightweight WebView host embedded in DCC applications
(Maya, Houdini, Blender, 3ds Max, Nuke, Unreal Engine). It has **no scene
graph, timeline, selection, undo stack, or render farm** of its own, so this
skill scopes itself to what a WebView host genuinely does: run JavaScript,
capture what is on screen, and load content.

## When to use this skill

- Inspect or mutate the DOM of a tool panel built with AuroraView.
- Capture a screenshot of a running AuroraView panel for review or docs.
- Navigate a panel to a URL, or inject HTML for a quick preview.
- Drive an AuroraView panel inside Maya/Houdini/Blender through a single,
  uniform tool set.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `eval_js` | Evaluate JavaScript in the panel and return the value. |
| `screenshot` | Capture the page as PNG via `window.auroraview.screenshot`. |
| `load_url` | Load a URL (`http://`, `https://`, `file://`). |
| `load_html` | Load raw HTML content. |

## Usage

```bash
# Read the panel title
dcc-mcp-cli call --tool eval_js --params '{"script": "document.title"}'

# Capture the current page
dcc-mcp-cli call --tool screenshot --params '{"format": "png"}'
```

## Notes

- `eval_js` waits for the JavaScript result and honours a timeout; it is not
  fire-and-forget.
- `screenshot` relies on the `window.auroraview.screenshot` helper that
  AuroraView injects into every page. Pages that load a strict Content
  Security Policy may block the html2canvas CDN dependency.
- AuroraView runs a Qt event loop. All invocations are dispatched on the host
  thread that owns the WebView.
