//! Window style utilities for WebView embedding
//!
//! This module provides platform-specific window style manipulation
//! for embedding WebView as a child window or setting owner relationships.
//!
//! # Window Relationships on Windows
//!
//! ## Child Window (WS_CHILD)
//! - Window is contained within parent's client area
//! - Cannot be moved independently
//! - Coordinates relative to parent
//! - Use for: Embedding WebView in Qt widgets
//!
//! ## Owner Window (GWLP_HWNDPARENT)
//! - Window stays above owner in Z-order
//! - Hidden when owner is minimized
//! - Destroyed when owner is destroyed
//! - Can be positioned freely on screen
//! - Use for: Floating tool windows, dialogs
//!

///      From this point on, re-entrant lookups from the WM_NCCALCSIZE
///      cascade find the real entry.

///      to make Windows re-run the NC pass with our subclass active.

/// In DCC-embedded mode (Maya/Houdini/3ds Max + Qt), the host's main thread
/// owns the message loop. When we are deep inside a synchronous Python → Rust
/// call (e.g. `core.show_embedded()`), the host's `GetMessage` loop is paused —
/// any messages produced during our Rust work pile up on this thread's queue.
///
/// Several Win32 calls used by `apply_child_window_style`
/// (`SetWindowLongW`, `SetParent`, `SetWindowPos`) trigger **synchronous**
/// `SendMessage` cascades to the modified window AND its descendants
/// (notably the WebView2 `Chrome_WidgetWin_*` child windows). For windows
/// owned by the **same thread**, `SendMessage` calls the target's `WndProc`
/// inline — but if the target's `WndProc` performs COM marshaling (which
/// WebView2 frequently does), the COM runtime needs the STA's message
/// pump to deliver its own asynchronous responses. With no pump running,
/// the call deadlocks.
///
/// Pumping a single round of pending messages right before / after each
/// big style mutation is the minimum invasive fix: it lets every pending
/// `WM_*` reach its `WndProc` (including any COM RPC reply windows) so the
/// next synchronous `SendMessage` cascade does not pile on top of an
/// already-saturated queue.

///     (e.g. Maya/Qt `WM_PAINT` / `WM_TIMER`).
